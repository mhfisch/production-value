    "> Initial recording sessions for the album were produced by John Leckie but the band soon decided to bring in producers George Drakoulias and Rick Rubin instead.[1] Eventually **Drakoulias and Rubin were rejected by the band and Bob Ezrin was brought in to complete the album.[1] As a result of this, the production credits for the album's lead single, \"Sound of Drums\", name Drakoulias and Rubin as producers, while the rest of Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts is produced by Ezrin.** Like its predecessor, K, the album continues the band's hybrid of 1960s-style psychedelic rock, groovy indie pop, and Indian instrumentation, albeit with a more progressive rock slant than on previous releases.[1] Musically, many of the songs make use of Beatles-influenced psychedelic effects, swirling guitars, and Indian chants.[1] This musical eclecticism prompted the band themselves to refer to Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts as their \"kitchen sink album\".[2]"
